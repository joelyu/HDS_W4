# _immune_markers.R
# Single source of truth: Danaher et al. 2017 marker gene list (Table 1)
#
# 60 genes across 14 cell types. CD4 T cells derived in 01-immune-cell-scoring.R
# as T-cell score minus CD8 score (not a separate gene set).
#
# Gene symbol verification:
#   All 60 symbols checked against the HGNC REST API (rest.genenames.org)
#   using /fetch/symbol, /search/prev_symbol, and /search/alias_symbol endpoints.
#   - KIAA0125 is a previous symbol for FAM30A (B-cells) — resolved to current name
#   - All other 59 symbols confirmed as current HGNC-approved names
#
# Platform coverage (Illumina HT-12 v3 microarray):
#   58/60 genes present in METABRIC expression data.
#   - TPSB2 (Mast cells, 1 of 5 markers) — absent from platform
#   - XCL2 (NK cells, 1 of 3 markers) — absent from platform
#   Both retained in this list so the coverage table (Table S1) reports 58/60.
#   Scoring proceeds with available markers (4/5 Mast, 2/3 NK).
